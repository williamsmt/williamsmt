## Is this thing on?? :bulb:

Hey, I'm Matt... Welcome to my collection of virtual goodies. I've been in the industry for a few years, most recently working at Google Cloud. Keep me honest on the things that don't work, and a :+1: on the things that do!

#### What I'm Focusing On :construction_worker:

1. IaC CI/CD pipelines
2. All things HashiCorp
3. Config management
4. Home lab overhead
